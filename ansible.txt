Prerequisites

1. One Ansible Control Node
The Ansible control node is the machine we’ll use to connect to and control the Ansible hosts over SSH.
In our case this is the native Ubuntu environment where we:

	- An SSH keypair associated with your control node’s non-root user with sudo privileges

2. Ansible Host
An Ansible host is any machine that your Ansible control node is configured to automate. The Ansible Host is essentially a remote Ubuntu 20.04 server that has the Ansible control node’s SSH public key added to the authorized_keys of a system user. This user can be either root or a regular user with sudo privileges.
	
	- edit the inventory file and set the ip address of your Ansible Host. Run this command in the ansible folder to test: ansible-inventory -i inventory --list
	- test the connection: ansible web -i inventory -m ping
	- test the connection by running a playbook: ansible-playbook -i inventory test.yml
